# Rapid7-Nexpose
This repo contains scripts I have written to interact with Rapid7's Nexpose API and get specific information about various scanned assets/categorizations using Pandas library.

# NOTES:
1. Ensure to change the host URL to your company's Nexpose API server.
2. Make sure to either create a "Data" directory in your code's directory, or change the path of all output files under 'save_data' method to whatever you prefer.
